# DVC (Data Version Control)

It is known as a method used in machine learning and data science projects to manage and version data over time. It is intended to work in conjunction with typical version control systems, such as Git, to assist and monitor changes in data files, making it easier to replicate and share experiments and machine learning models in a collaborative/dynamic environment.
